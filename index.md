### CPSC 120

* Lab 3 Part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was one of the first labs that was very easy to code. It was also the first lab that I was able to do the quickest. The lab also had me learn many different parts of coding that I previously didn’t learn. 

* Lab 5 Part 1 was another lab with similar qualities to lab 3, so it was one of my favorites again. This lab allowed me to understand how to define a function effectively with a formula. It was also fun to code test as it helped me understand arguments. 

*Lab 7 Part 1 is the last lab that I would consider to be my “favorite.” This was the first lab that I struggled with, which adds to why I liked it so much. It gave me room to think outside the box and understand how to otrganize the if statements.
